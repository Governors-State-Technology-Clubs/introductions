Jacob Abrams - Introduction
GSU Software Engineering Club
------------------------------

Hey guys, nice to meet everyone. I am excited to serve as the treasurer for Software Engineering club for the Fall 2024 semester.
Academically, I am a junior computer science major interested in topics at the intersection of technology and criminal justice reform.
I've done research on algorithmic risk asseesmeent instruments used in American criminal courts and predicitive policing models. My mission is to use technology for social good.
I am a novice programmer, but am strongest in Java and C++ languages. 

Otherwise, I play bass and guitar, play video games and some tabletop games, like working out a little bit, and spending time with my friends and girlfriend.
Looking forward to working and meeting everyone!
